# 🔍 How to Fix the "Error loading data" Issue

## What's Happening?
The dashboard shows "Error loading data. Please refresh." because one of the API calls is failing.

## How to Diagnose

### Step 1: Check Session
Open: **http://localhost/To-Do List/session-debug.html**

This will show you:
- ✓ If you're logged in
- ✓ If the server recognizes your session
- ✓ Which API endpoints are failing

### Step 2: Read the Results

When you open session-debug.html, look for:

**Green ✓ = Good**
- "Session Check: LOGGED IN"
- "getUserStats: SUCCESS"
- "getHabits: SUCCESS"
- "getTasks: SUCCESS"
- "Dashboard would load successfully!"

**Red ✗ = Problem**
- "Session Check: NOT LOGGED IN" → Need to log in again
- "getUserStats: FAIL" → Database issue
- "getHabits: FAIL" → Database issue
- "getTasks: FAIL" → Database issue

### Step 3: What to Do Based on Results

**Problem: "NOT LOGGED IN"**
1. Go to: http://localhost/To-Do List/auth.php
2. Log out completely
3. Log back in
4. Try dashboard again

**Problem: API says "FAIL"**
1. Check if MySQL is running
2. Check if Apache is running
3. Go to: http://localhost/To-Do List/quick-check.php
4. Look for any red ✗ marks
5. Fix what's shown as failing

**Everything shows SUCCESS but dashboard still fails**
1. Open browser console (F12 → Console tab)
2. Look for error messages
3. Refresh the page
4. Take a screenshot of errors if it persists

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Open http://localhost/To-Do List/session-debug.html
- [ ] Click "Check Browser State" button
