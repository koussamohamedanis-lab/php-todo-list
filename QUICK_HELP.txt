# ⚡ QUICK REFERENCE - Error Persists

## IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED

The error "Error loading data. Please refresh." is still happening because **the APIs are actually failing**, not because of session issues.

### Right Now - Do This:

1. **Open**: http://localhost/To-Do List/simple-api-test.html
2. **Look at the boxes** - Are they GREEN (success) or RED (failed)?
3. **Take a screenshot** and tell me what you see

### That's It for Now

The test page will show me exactly what's broken.

---

## What Each Color Means

**🟢 GREEN boxes** = "API Call Successful!"
→ The API is working
→ Try a different browser or clear cache
→ Problem is client-side

**🔴 RED boxes** = Error or message shown
→ Tell me the error message
→ I can identify the exact problem
→ Will give you a specific fix

**⚠️ Network error** = Can't reach server
→ Apache is probably not running
→ Open XAMPP Control Panel
→ Click "Start" next to Apache

---

## If Apache Isn't Running

1. Open XAMPP Control Panel
2. Find "Apache" row
3. Click "Start" if it's red
4. Wait 10 seconds
5. Try dashboard again

## Alternative Quick Tests

If simple-api-test.html doesn't work, try:

1. **Check Server**: http://localhost/To-Do List/index.html
   - If loads → Server OK
   - If doesn't load → Apache down

2. **Check Database**: http://localhost/To-Do List/test-db-connection.php
   - If shows "Connected" → Database OK
   - If shows error → MySQL down

3. **Check PHP**: http://localhost/To-Do List/check-php-errors.php
   - Shows PHP info and errors

## The 3-Step Fix

2. **Screenshot**: What you see
3. **Tell me**: Green or Red? What message?
